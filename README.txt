credgen is a lightweight password generator written in C for Linux and BSD
using OpenBSD's arc4random library. In addition to keyset filtering and output
formatting options, it contains an embedded dictionary of common English words
as a generation option.

This software is tested on 64 bit Debian and FreeBSD.
